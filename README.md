# Real-Time Age, Gender & Emotion Detection using Deep Learning

## Project Overview

This project is an end-to-end Computer Vision application that performs:

* Face Detection
* Age Classification
* Gender Classification
* Emotion Recognition

The system supports both static image inference and real-time webcam prediction through an interactive Streamlit application.

The project demonstrates the complete Deep Learning workflow including dataset preprocessing, custom dataset creation, transfer learning, model fine-tuning, evaluation, inference pipelines, and deployment.

# Motivation

Human face analysis is one of the most widely used applications of Computer Vision. Many real-world systems require automatic extraction of facial attributes such as:

* Estimated age
* Gender
* Emotional state

Examples include:

* Smart surveillance systems
* Human-computer interaction
* Customer analytics
* Healthcare applications
* Retail analytics
* Interactive AI assistants

This project combines all three tasks into a single application.

# Features

## Face Detection

Faces are detected using OpenCV Haar Cascade Classifiers before classification.

## Age Classification

Predicts one of six age groups:

| Class | Age Group |
| ----- | --------- |
| 0     | 0-10      |
| 1     | 11-20     |
| 2     | 21-30     |
| 3     | 31-40     |
| 4     | 41-50     |
| 5     | 51+       |

---

## Gender Classification

Predicts:

* Male
* Female

---

## Emotion Recognition

Predicts seven facial emotions:

* Angry
* Disgust
* Fear
* Happy
* Neutral
* Sad
* Surprise

---

## Real-Time Webcam Inference

The webcam application:

* Detects faces in real time
* Crops face regions
* Performs Age prediction
* Performs Gender prediction
* Performs Emotion prediction
* Displays predictions directly on video frames

---

## Streamlit Web Application

Supports:

### Image Upload

Upload an image and receive:

* Age prediction
* Gender prediction
* Emotion prediction
* Prediction confidence scores

### Live Webcam

Perform real-time facial analysis directly from the browser.
